- 👋 Hi, I’m Nick (@nsmsn)
- I’m interested in user interface design, digital accessibility, and personal websites (IndieWeb).
- I’m currently learning about web components, modern CSS, and data visualization.
- I’m looking to collaborate on anything that helps newcomers build an online presence or contribute to open source.
