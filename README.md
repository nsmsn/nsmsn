# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nick (@nsmsn)

Iâ€™m interested in user interface design, digital accessibility, and personal websites (IndieWeb).

Iâ€™m currently learning about web components, data visualization, and new features arriving in CSS.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that helps newcomers build an online presence or contribute to open source.
